# A program for the RE-TI that calculates the Faculty of a chosen POSITIVE number:
# Assumes that the chosen number is in memory[10]
# Output will be stored at memory[20]

# Load 5 from memory[10] into ACC (ACC is used as loop counter)
LOAD ACC 10;

# Initialize IN1 = 1 (result)
LOADI IN1 1;
JUMP= 4; # Special Case: 0! = 1

# Loop
MULR IN1 ACC;
SUBI ACC 1;
JUMP> -2 # If ACC > 0, we are not yet finished 

STORE IN1 20;
JUMP 0;
